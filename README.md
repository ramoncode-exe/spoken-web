## 📘 About the Project

**Spoken** helps you learn between **3,000 to 5,000 of the most frequently used English words** — the vocabulary that truly matters for real-life conversations and comprehension.

No subscriptions, no fluff — just what works.

> 💡 This project was built by me, **Ramon Patrick**, a self-taught developer who immigrated to Europe alone at age 19 and learned to code from scratch. Spoken is the result of my personal journey with the English language and my desire to help others succeed as well.
